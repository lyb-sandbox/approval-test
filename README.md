# approval-test
Testing concept of Approval and Checks in GitHub Actions

Tested successfully when repository access set to public.

Environment protection rules and environment secrets are only available on public repositories. If you convert a repository from public to private, any configured protection rules or environment secrets will be ignored, and you will not be able to configure any environments. If you convert your repository back to public, you will have access to any previously configured protection rules and environment secrets.

Although, Protection rules are available for private repos if you are part of an organization with an Enterprise Plan.
